If some of your projects have multiple environments (e.g. development, staging, production - with nearly the same directory and files structure), then there is a situations when you need to connect to one of this environments via ssh and remotely edit project-related files. Usually you will do something like this:

ssh user@host
cd path/to/you/project
vim /some/file
and so on...

This plugin was created to simplify this process by maintaining special configuration file and adding different commands for quickly doing remote actions for each environment of project you working with.
